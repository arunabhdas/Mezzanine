# Mezzanine Onboarding Sequence
Welcome to the Mezzanine spatial matrix. Your neural adaptation period begins now. Statistically, 87% of users require less than four attempts before achieving baseline competence. I'm monitoring your progress with detached scientific curiosity.

Please calibrate your proprioceptive sensors to the environmental parameters. Or as you might understand it: wave your appendages until something happens.

The interaction vectors require precise digital manipulation. In layman's terms: don't poke it like you're attempting to resuscitate deceased fauna.

The Mezzanine onboarding sequence has concluded. You've demonstrated marginal proficiency. My expectations have been appropriately recalibrated.
